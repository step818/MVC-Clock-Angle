# _Clock Angle Calculator_

#### By _**Stephen Trewick**_

## Description

This exercise was designed in C#, MVC.Net framework, and is mostly practice with the .Net framework using RESTful routing and CRUD methods. I created a calculator, that takes two inputs from a user and returns two corresponding results. The first input requests a number between 1 and 12, and the second input requests a number between 00 and 59. These numbers represent the hour and minute hand of a clock. When the user clicks the submit button, another view with a statement that contains the resulting two explementary angles is shown.

----------

## Setup/Installation Requirements

In the terminal, `cd ` to the directory folder.

Then `cd` to `MVC-Clock-Angle` folder.

Run `dotnet build` and `dotnet run` to compile.

Using a web browser, go to localhost:5000 to load the application.

Enjoy!
